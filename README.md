# Uplift Project 6 - Grading System with Analysis

This app is our last individual project in camp and showcases the culmination of our learnings in Uplift Code Camp.

This app is an online class record with student and class grade analysis.
It should help the teacher identify which subject or subject topic the student struggles and can help them improve.
It can be also used to analyze the teacher's skills on teaching based on the class performance.
